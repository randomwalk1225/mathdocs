\subsection*{Ex. 6}
There are only red balls and green balls in a bag.

When I pick a ball from the bag, the probability of picking a red ball is $p$ and the probability of picking a green ball is $q$, where $q \geq p$.

I pick a ball from the bag and record its colour. I then replace the ball in the bag.

I repeat this procedure once.

Given that

\[P(\text{the balls are of the same colour}) - P(\text{the balls are of different colours}) = \frac{1}{4}\]

\[\frac{q}{p} - \frac{p}{q}\]

Billie has a die with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 on its six faces.

Niles has a die which has the numbers 4, 4, 4, 5, 5 and 5 on its six faces.

When Billie and Niles roll their dice the one with the larger number wins. If the two numbers are equal it is a draw.

The probability that Niles wins, when written as a fraction in its lowest terms, is $\frac{p}{q}$. What is the value of $7p + 11q$?

\subsection*{Ex. 9}
Tom and Geri have a competition. Initially, each player has one attempt at hitting a target. If one player hits the target and the other does not then the successful player wins.
