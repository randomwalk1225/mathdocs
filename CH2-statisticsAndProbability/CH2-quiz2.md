### Q4
Aris, Boris, Clarice and Doris have to decide who will do the washing up. They decide to throw a fair 6-sided die: if it lands showing a 5 or 6, Aris will wash up; otherwise they throw again. The second time, if the result is a 5 or 6, Boris will wash up; otherwise they throw one last time. The final time, if the result is a 5 or 6, Clarice washes up, and otherwise it's Doris. (Of course, this is not a fair procedure!) Of the four, who is second most likely to do the washing up?

- *n* students selected both.
- 3*n* + 1 students selected tomato sauce.
- 3*n* − 1 students selected only mayonnaise.

All the balls are identical in every respect, apart from colour.

One of the two boxes is chosen at random by tossing two fair coins, as follows:
