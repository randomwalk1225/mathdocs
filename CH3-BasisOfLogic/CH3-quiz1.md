### Ex. 5
There are four double-sided cards, and each has a letter on one side and a number on the other. The faces that are up are showing "6", "E", "Q" and "7". They are supposed to obey the following rule: "If there is a vowel on one side, then the card has an even number on the other side."

Question: To see that the rule has been kept, which card(s) must be turned over and checked?

### Ex. 6
I make the following statements:
- Statement P: if a pig has horns, then it can breathe fire.
- Statement Q: if a pig can breathe fire, then it has wings.
- Statement R: if a pig has wings, then it has horns.

Each statement is either true or false, but I don't know which.

I then see a pig with wings breathing fire. It has no horns.

Which statements, if any, can I now conclude are definitely true or definitely false?

- (A) none of them
- (B) P only
- (C) Q only
- (D) R only
- (E) P and Q only
- (F) P and R only
- (G) Q and R only

### Ex. 7
Judge whether the following statements are true or false.
- (i) *ab* is even if both *a* and *b* are even.
- (ii) *ab* is even only if both *a* and *b* are even.
- (iii) *a* = *b* if *a*² = *b*².
- (iv) *a* = *b* only if *a*² = *b*².
- (v) a triangle is equilateral if it has three equal sides.
- (vi) a triangle is equilateral only if it has three equal sides.

### Ex. 8
State whether the following are true or false:
- (i) an even number is prime iff it is 2.
- (ii) an odd number is prime iff it is 3.
- (iii) *x* = 3 iff *x*² − 9 = 0.
- (iv) a triangle with sides of lengths *a*, *b* and *c* is right-angled iff *a*² + *b*² = *c*².
- (v) a triangle is scalene iff no two angles are the same.

For those parts where the statement is false, re-write the statement using "if" or "only if" to make it true.

### Ex. 9
A curve has the equation *y* = *ax*³ + *bx*² + *c*. The curve has a maximum stationary point at *x* = 0 and a minimum stationary point in the 4th quadrant (that is, the region where *x* > 0 and *y* < 0).

Which of the following set of conditions is sufficient to ensure this?

### Ex. 13
Portia has three boxes made from gold, silver and lead. She has placed a prize in one of these boxes and challenges a friend, Bassanio, to find the prize.

She explains that on each box there is a message which may be true or false. On the basis of these messages Bassanio should be able to choose the box with the prize in.

**(i)** Initially suppose that there are only two boxes, gold and silver, one of which contains the prize. The messages read:
- Gold: The prize is not in here.
- Silver: Exactly one of these messages is true.

Which box contains the prize? Explain your answer.

**(ii)** Now suppose that there are all three boxes and that Portia has left the following messages on them:
- Gold: The prize is in here.
- Silver: The prize is in here.
- Lead: At least two of these messages are false.

Which box should Bassanio choose? Explain your answer.

**(iii)** In this version of the challenge, Portia puts a dagger into one of the boxes. Bassanio must choose a box that does not contain the dagger. The messages on the boxes now read as follows:
- Gold: The dagger is in this box.
- Silver: The dagger is not in this box.
- Lead: At most one of these messages is true.

Which box should Bassanio choose? Explain your answer.

### Ex. 14

### Ex. 15
I have two dice whose faces are all painted different colours. I number the faces of one of them 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6 and the other 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6. I can now throw a total of 3 in two different ways using the two number 2's on the first die once each. Show that there are seven different ways of throwing a total of 6.

I now renumber the dice (again only using integers in the range 1 to 6) with the results shown in the following table:

| Total shown by the two dice | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|------------------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|-----|
| Different ways of obtaining the total | 0 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 6 | 0 |

Find how I have numbered the dice explaining your reasoning.
[You will only get high marks if the examiner can follow your argument.]

### Ex. 16
A Minister and a Bishop were having a cup of tea. There was a knock at the door, and three bell ringers entered the room. After introductions, the Bishop asked the Minister how old the bell ringers were.

"Well," the Minister said, knowing the Bishop had a penchant for numerical puzzles, "if you multiplied their three ages together, you'd get 2,450. But if you added them, you'd get twice your age."

"Hmm," the Bishop muttered, after several moments' thought. "I haven't enough information to solve that."

"It may help, my dear Bishop," offered the Minister, "to know that I am older than anyone else here in the room."

"Yes, indeed it would," replied the Bishop. "Now I know their ages."

The question is: How old is the Minister?

You may assume that all ages are integers.
