## Practice Questions

### Q1
*a*, *b* and *c* are real numbers.

Given that *ab* = *ac*, which of the following statements must be true?

- I: *a* = 0
- II: *b* = 0 or *c* = 0
- III: *b* = *c*

Options:

- (B) I only
- (C) II only
- (D) III only
- (E) I and II only
- (F) I and III only
- (G) II and III only

1. −*b* ≥ −*a*
2. *a*² + *b*² ≥ 2*ab*
3. *ac* ≥ *bc*

### Q3 [TMUA, 2018S2Q8]
The diagram shows an example of a mountain profile.

This consists of upstrokes which go upwards from left to right, and downstrokes which go downwards from left to right. The example shown has six upstrokes and six downstrokes. The horizontal line at the bottom is known as sea level.

A mountain profile of order *n* consists of *n* upstrokes and *n* downstrokes, with the condition that the profile begins and ends at sea level and never goes below sea level (although it might reach sea level at any point). So the example shown is a mountain profile of order 6.

Mountain profiles can be coded by using U to indicate an upstroke and D to indicate a downstroke. The example shown has the code UDUUUDUDDUDD. A sequence of U's and D's obtained from a mountain profile in this way is known as a valid code.

Which of the following statements is/are true?

- I: If a valid code is written in reverse order, the result is always a valid code.
- II: If each U in a valid code is replaced by D and each D by U, the result is always a valid code.
- III: If U is added at the beginning of a valid code and D is added at the end of the code, the result is always a valid code.

Options:
- (A) none of them
- (B) I only
- (C) II only
- (D) III only
- (E) I and II only
- (F) I and III only
- (G) II and III only
- (H) I, II and III

### Q4 [TMUA, 2020S2Q19]
Nine people are sitting in the squares of a 3 by 3 grid, one in each square, as shown. Two people are called neighbours if they are sitting in squares that share a side. (People in diagonally adjacent squares, which only have a point in common, are not called neighbours.)

Each of the nine people in the grid is either a truth-teller who always tells the truth, or a liar who always lies.

Every person in the grid says: 'My neighbours are all liars'.

Given only this information, what are the smallest number and the largest number of people who could be telling the truth?

- (A) smallest: 1, largest: 4
- (B) smallest: 2, largest: 4
- (C) smallest: 2, largest: 5
- (D) smallest: 3, largest: 4
- (E) smallest: 3, largest: 5
- (F) smallest: 4, largest: 4
- (G) smallest: 4, largest: 5
- (H) smallest: 5, largest: 5

about a real number *x*,

- (B) Q implies P, but P does not imply Q.
- (C) P implies Q, and Q implies P.
- (D) P and Q contradict each other.

### Q17
The Tour de Clochemerle is not yet as big as the rival Tour de France. This year there were five riders, Arouet, Barthes, Camus, Diderot and Eluard, who took part in five stages. The winner of each stage got 5 points, the runner up 4 points and so on down to the last rider who got 1 point. The total number of points acquired over the five stages was the rider's score. Each rider obtained a different score overall and the riders finished the whole tour in alphabetical order with Arouet gaining a magnificent 24 points. Camus showed consistency by gaining the same position in four of the five stages and Eluard's rather dismal performance was relieved by a third place in the fourth stage and first place in the final stage.

Explain why Eluard must have received 11 points in all and find the scores obtained by Barthes, Camus and Diderot.

Where did Barthes come in the final stage?
